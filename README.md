# Neural-Network-Multithread
<b>Story :</b> This project was created when I started learning about convolutional neural network and attempted to speed it up. The network was implemented from scratch using only C++ standard libraries. After spending hours to learn about multi-thread and code the solution, I finally completed the upgraded version.

<b>Result :</b> When running with 4 core cpus, speed increased to about 384% compared with 1 cpu.
